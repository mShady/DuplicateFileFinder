# Specification: Windows Compatibility Verification

## 1. Overview
This track focuses on verifying the functionality and UX of the Duplicate File Finder on the Windows platform. Since development is primarily happening on macOS, this track serves as a dedicated bucket for deferred Windows verification tasks.

## 2. Verification Scope
- **App Launch:** Verify the app launches correctly on Windows 10/11.
- **Title & Branding:** Verify the application title is "Duplicate File Finder".
- **Native Integrations:**
    - Verify "Move to Recycle Bin" works as expected.
    - Verify "Open in Explorer" works as expected.
    - Verify File System scanning permissions.

## 3. Success Criteria
- All manual verification steps that were deferred from the MVP track must be executed and passed on a physical or virtual Windows machine.
